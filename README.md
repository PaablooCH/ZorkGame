## Guide
The game consists of 6 rooms in the following disposition (| or - are the exits ex.: J is conected by the north with M and M by the west with J):

  T-G
  |
- M A
| |
J G 


* J - Jail: you can find a Corpse to Loot, you will obtain a bandage
* M - Main Hall: you can find a creature KnightGroup, if you kill and loot them you will obtain a bandage
* G - Garden: you can find a Wizard, if you kill and loot him you will obtain an upgrade to combine with a sword or shield (you cannot upgrade an item that you already equipped)
* A - Armory: you can find a shield and a sword
* T - Throne: you can find a GoldenKnight, you can talk or kill him, if you kill and loot him you will obtain a GoldenKey
* G - GoldenRoom: you can find a GiantGoblin, if you kill and loot him you will obtain a medal (need GoldenKey to access)

To win you need to loot the medal, and for that you need to kill the GiantGoblin inside the GoldenRoom. To access there you will need the GoldenKey kept by the GoldenKnight. The GiantGoblin is pretty strong, so to win him you need to equip an upgraded sword, you will find the Sword at the armory, with the Shield, and you can upgrade it combining it with the Upgrade found in when you loot the wizard. Bandages will also be necessary.
